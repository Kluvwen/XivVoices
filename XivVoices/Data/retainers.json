  "I have returned, and gods have I worked up a thirst! Oh, and this is for you!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "I'm off for another glass, then. You know where to find me!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "I'll head back out, then. Duty first, debauchery second!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "But of course, miss! I'm not as - hic - unsteady as all that!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "But of course, sir! I'm not as - hic - unsteady as all that!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Not bad, eh? In fact, I think we should pop a cork to celebrate!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Need my assistance, do you? Let's make this quick, then.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Yes? This is interfering with your venture, just so you know.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "I did what you asked. You'll be wanting my full report, then?": "Viera Retainer M",
  "What - is that it? Are you sure you need a retainer?": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Hmph. You're sure that's everything? I'd rather not be running back and forth, if it's all the same to you.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "I'll take care of it. Just as long as you're suitably grateful.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "This is what you wanted, yes? I told you I'd take care of it.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "You have my ear, milady. Both of them, in fact!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "You have my ear, milord. Both of them, in fact!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Is something amiss? Or did you simply miss me?": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Wait until you see the goods I got my paws on!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "Nothing else? Then I shall be hopping along.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "I really must be on the road again. Pray no harm befalls my soft, furry hide!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "I'll see it done in two shakes of a rabbit's tail!": "Viera Retainer M",
  "And there you have it, milord - all wrapped up like a Hatching-tide gift basket.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "And there you have it, milady - all wrapped up like a Hatching-tide gift basket.": "Viera Retainer M",
  "What will it be, love?": "Viera Retainer F",

  "I have returned, love. And do I have a tale to tell...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Must we part so soon?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "If ever you're feeling lonely, I am but a ring of the bell away.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Anything for you, love.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I do hope it pleases you.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Your orders! I would hear them at once!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "What is the matter? Why do you summon me back so soon!?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Hah! Now that was a venture for the ages!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "And I am off!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I am off! At least until you call me back again...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Hah! Leave it to me!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Behold! This is what you seek, yes!?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "If there is something you would ask of me, then ask it.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I trust there is a good reason for this interruption?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "There are places I would rather be, yet here I am. Be grateful.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Call on me as you please. If I am so inclined, I will answer.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "The road calls me again.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "A less-than-stimulating task, but I will acquiesce.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I believe this is what you sought of me.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Yes...? Is there something you - <yawn> - need?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "<yawn> You do know I was in the middle of something...yes?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "<yawn> Oh...that's right. I had something to tell you.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "That is all, I suppose...? <yawn> Very well...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "<yawn> I really could use a nap...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Very well...if you insist.": "Viera Retainer F",
  "The deed is done. <yawn> Now, time for a rest...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "A task for me? I hope it's something fun!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "What is it this time? I was just beginning to have some fun...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I've returned! Come now, are you not happy to see me?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "That is all? Oh, I was hoping there'd be more...": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Well, back to the grind! I do hope you appreciate all this!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "That certainly sounds interesting! Well, I'd best be on my way!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Well? Do you like it? Oh, say that you do!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I am here to do your every bidding, Mistress! Ask of me anything at all!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I am here to do your every bidding, Master! Ask of me anything at all!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "You frightened me, Mistress! Is something the matter!?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "You frightened me, Master! Is something the matter!?": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I could scarcely wait to return to your side, Mistress!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "I could scarcely wait to return to your side, Master!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Is that all you need of me? But I could yet serve you in so many ways!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "If that is all, I shall return to my task. Ah, the joy of adventure!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "If that is your heart's desire, then so it shall be!": "Viera Retainer F",
  "Behold the fruits of my labor! I do hope it is everything you expected.": "Viera Retainer F"
